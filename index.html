                There’s no question that the time kids spend at school is important to their development: not just the essential knowledge and skills they learn, but also the social experiences they gain from working alongside their peers. Social skills, teamwork, and
                education are linked, which is part of the reason why school closures and academic schedule disruptions are such an issue for a developing brain.

                Earnings are the net benefits of a corporation's operation.[1] Earnings is also the amount on which corporate tax is due. For an analysis of specific aspects of corporate operations several more specific terms are used as EBIT (earnings before interest
                and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Many alternative terms for earnings are in common use, such as income and profit. These terms in turn have a variety of definitions, depending on
                their context and the objectives of the authors. For instance, the IRS uses the term profit to describe earnings, whereas for the corporation the profit it reports is the amount left after taxes are taken out.

                Play role in Growth of GDP
            </div>
            <div class="para ">
                GDP definitions are maintained by a number of national and international economic organizations. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines GDP as "an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values
                added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs) ".[6] An IMF publication states that, "GDP measures the
                monetary value of final goods and services—that are bought by the final user—produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). "[7] GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad
                measure of economic progress. It is often considered to be the "world 's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress".[8

                Many times you may have to go ahead in faith, unable to see the full reason for the action you are taking, but do not hesitate when you know within that it is right. You must have faith to be able to take steps into the unknown, for there may be many
                outer influences pulling you this way and that until you feel torn to pieces. This is where you have to learn to go within and know with absolute knowing that what you are doing is being guided by Me and will work out perfectly.
